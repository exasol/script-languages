Usage:

    ccc make
    ccc make [TARGET...] [OPTIONS]

Targets:

    make
    install
    package


Details:

This working copy is a runtime, and it the building process of it
slightly differs from the building process of exasolution or cos.
For instance, it has special several stages, and several targets

The runtime building process consists of several steps:

* seed (initial chroot environment)     (building time: 5m)
* toolchain (glibc + gcc)               (building time: 15m)
* ports (the rest)                      (building time: 20m)

On each step, the target can be either built, or fetched
from the special location if it was built and saved before.

To build seed:

    ccc make seed (sudo bash toolchain/builder install)

To build the toolchain:

    ccc make toolchain

And to build the ports:

    ccc make ports [all|continue|PORTS...]

If no argument is specifed, `all` is implied.
In this case all ports are rebuilt from scratch.
Special target `continue` means, that the build process should
continue from the point where it was interrupted.

Please note that for the first two steps you need the root rights,
and the building script uses `sudo` on that stages.
